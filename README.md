Visualizing Boston Bike Share Data

With data released from late August 2011 - early October 2012

Bikes were not used in December, January, or February (it was winter in Boston)

## Splitting Bikeshare Data

The full trips.csv file was split into an active bike CSV for each day using the script at
data/TripSplitter.py. Active bike CSVs include bike rentals for that day, and bike rentals which span multiple days.
